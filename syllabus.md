# Astro/Phys Data Science Seminar

*Syllabus - Spring 2018*



## Logistics

Instructor: [James Davenport](http://jradavenport.github.io)

Email: James.Davenport@wwu.edu

Class: Wednesdays, 4-5:30pm


## Seminar Goals
Give students a broad overview of data analysis, making professional looking data visualizations, writing useful code, and open source software practices.


## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have used Python previously at some point (e.g. in Phys courses), but mastery is not expected. No formal course prerequisites are in place, but the seminar assumes students have taken the first year of Physics. Labs are based on *real* astronomy research topics, but are of general interest to all Phys/Astr majors.

Students are welcome (or even encouraged) to use their own laptops for the seminar. Using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) package for Python is **strongly** recommended (Python 3.6), and is easily installed on Mac/Windows/Linux platforms.

Labs will be carried out using data provided each week, and explored using Jupyter (formerly IPython) Notebooks.

Students will need a GitHub account to turn assignments in.


## Classroom Behavior
While the seminar is informal in nature, normal rules of academic classroom behavior are expected. Please ask questions, and engage with the instructor and your peers. Be respectful of those who are talking by actively listening. Disruptive, rude, or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated
